Forward-mode AD (tangent)
=========================

The derivative of the Fortran source code is constructed using a source-to-source 
and line-by-line approach, transforming the target routine into a tangent routine, 
which computes the derivatives of the dependent variables with respect to the 
independent variables.

This is implemented in PSyclone by parsing the source code file containing the 
target routine, and eventually the routines it calls, transforming it into a 
PSyIR AST and applying :ref:`forward-mode automatic differentiation 
transformations <forward_transformations>` to the nodes thus obtained. 
The resulting PSyIR tree is then written to Fortran source code.

.. _forward_transformations:

Forward-mode transformations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All forward-mode AD transformations, to be applied to PSyIR nodes,
follow the naming convention ``ADForward[PSyIRNodeSubclass]Trans``.
The one users should use is 
:ref:`ADForwardContainerTrans <forward_container_trans>` class and its 
``apply`` method.

.. _forward_container_trans:

Container transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: psyclone.autodiff.transformations.ADForwardContainerTrans
      :members: apply

After parsing the Fortran code file containing the target routine, an
``ADForwardContainerTrans`` instance should be applied to it to perform 
automatic differentiation.  
This in turn applies an 
``ADForwardRoutineTrans`` to the target routine, which goes line-by-line through
the statements found in the ``Routine`` node, applying 
``ADForward[PSyIRNodeSubclass]Trans`` to the statements, etc.

For descriptions of the arguments, see the relevant sections of 
:ref:`ADReverseContainerTrans <reverse_container_trans>`: 
:ref:`target routine<target_routine>`, 
:ref:`dependent variables<dependent_variables>` (to be differentiated) 
and :ref:`independent variables<independent_variables>` (to differentiate with 
respect to).

The transformation returns a PSyIR ``Container`` node containing two 
``Routine`` definitions for:

- the original target routine,
- the transformed tangent routine, which computes of the required derivatives.

If some other routine is called by the target one, the returned ``Container`` 
node also contains the original and tangent definitions for it.


Generating derivatives
++++++++++++++++++++++

The transformations applied to generate derivatives are detailled below.
They mostly follow the guidelines found in :footcite:t:`griewank-walther` 
chapter 6.2, p.123.
