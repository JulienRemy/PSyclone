    "A more convenient `foo_jacobian(f, g, x, w)` subroutine is also generated, due to the option `'jacobian' = True`.\n",
    "It can be called without bothering about defining initials values of the adjoints arguments to obtain the Jacobian of $\\begin{pmatrix} f \\\\ g \\end{pmatrix}$ with respect to $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ w \\end{pmatrix}$ since the variables are all scalar valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reversal schedules\n",
    "The reversal used here was an `ADSplitReversalSchedule`, meaning that when the *recording routine* `foo_rec` is called, recording values to the tape, it calls `bar_rec`, which records as well, and the same for the *returning routins* `foo_ret` and `bar_ret`.\n",
    "To achieve this, the corresponding slice of the tape of `foo` is passed as argument to `bar_rec` and `bar_ret`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching to an `ADJointReversalSchedule`, `foo_rec` calls the original (or advancing) `bar`, while `foo_ret` calls the *reversing routine* `bar_rev`, itself calling its recording and returning routines.\n",

    "## Limitations and ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors and matrices\n",
    "For now `psyclone.autodiff` only supports real, scalar variables.\n",
    "As it is, even `ArrayReference` nodes with `Literal` shape dimensions will raise errors, mostly because creating their adjoint variables is not supported yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Containers\n",
    "For now the definitions of called routines should all be in the `container` node argument of the `ADContainerTrans`, or a descendant node of it.\n",
    "The transformed routines are all added to that `container`, independently of where they were found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taping\n",
    "Due to the absence of activity and TBR analyses, note that some values (*eg* the first of `c` in `bar`) are not used afterwards and yet taped.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would probably be easier to store every value in a single 1 dimensional array, by inserting vectors and matrices after flattening them, than try to use a tape containing elements of different dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the diversity of types (mostly real values but maybe sometimes a few integers?) and kinds, it might make sense to have multiple tapes or a single one accepting these different types and kinds, if that's doable in Fortan and PSyclone (pointers? allocate attributes in a derived type serving as element of the tape?).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjoint datatype\n",
    "For now all adjoints default to `double precision`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For vector variables we'd need to determine the shape. \n",
    "In particular for intermediate operations datatypes, see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations results\n",
    "For now non assigned operation results are not taped but recomputed, even when they appear in subsequent adjoint computations.\n",
    "Implementing the datatypes of `psyclone.psyir.nodes.[Unary, Binary, Nary]Operation` nodes might be useful for this. Types and kinds seem to follow fairly simple rules (except in a few cases?). \n",
    "Shapes of vectors and matrices would be needed to tape vector operations results and deduce the shapes of adjoints when extending to vector-valued variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For loops, control flow, functions, programs\n",
    "None of these were implement yet.\n",
    "- Control flow, functions (and programs, if useful at all) should be pretty easy.\n",
    "    - For **control flow**, either record the boolean values of conditions or tag (index) the conditional branches and record which were taken.\n",
    "    - **Functions** will need to have adjoints defined, same as done for operations (`op_adj` variables).\n",
    "    - Pass the its (result) adjoint to the transformed fonction as an argument.\n",
    "    - Either pass the tape and have the function modify it (not very Fortran-minded?) or transform the function to a subroutine?\n",
    "- `do` loops with split reversal schedules may require a run-time index offset to either pass the correct slice `(i:)` of the caller routine, or to know the first index to use in the called routine. In any case, the called recording routine should probably return the number of tape elements it wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity analysis\n",
    "This is essentially dependence DAG related. Note that this would be useful for the transformation of called routines (see the previous cell for the way it's currently done).\n",
    "\n",
    "### TBR (to be recorded) analysis\n",
    "Using the dependence DAG, determine if the values of `Reference` nodes appear as arguments of subsequent active `Call` or **non-linear** `Operation` nodes (on the differentiated side or the other, depending on the operator. Consider *eg* `x*y` and `x**2`.).\n",
    "For the result values of `Operation` nodes, it may not always make sense to tape them at all, depending on how many there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taping vs recomputing\n",
    "Recomputing and checkpointing strategies should ideally be implemented. \n",
    "Their efficiency clearly depends on the activity analysis, there is no point evaluating the whole routine again for a single value amongst many when it can be helped."
