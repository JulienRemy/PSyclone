        If the RHS is an Operation node, `apply` applies an \
        `ADReverseOperationTrans` to it.

        The `recording` motion is a copy of the Assignment.

        The `returning` motion is built in the following way.
        If the RHS is a Literal node, this sets the LHS adjoint to 0.
        If the RHS is a Reference node:
        - if it is also the LHS, it does nothing.
        - otherwise it increments the RHS adjoint by the LHS one, \
            then sets the LHS adjoint to 0.
        If the RHS is an Operation node, this applies an \
            `ADReverseOperationTrans` to it, then using its results:
        - it increments the adjoints of all Reference nodes on the RHS, \
            *except for the LHS one if the assignment is iterative*,
        - it sets the LHS adjoint to 0,
        - it increments the LHS adjoint due to its RHS occurences if this was \
            an iterative assignment.
