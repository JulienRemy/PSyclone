Introduction
============

PSyclone ``autodiff`` module is PSyclone's **prototype** implementation of 
source-to-source 
:ref:`automatic differentiation (AD) <automatic_differentiation>`. 
It takes generic Fortran code and applies automatic differentiation in 
:ref:`forward-mode (tangent) <forward_mode>` or 
:ref:`reverse-mode (adjoint) <reverse_mode>`.  

It is inspired by 
`Tapenade <https://team.inria.fr/ecuador/en/tapenade/>`_ (see :footcite:t:`tapenade` and :footcite:p:`tapenade-user-guide`), 
which is also used to perform numerical tests of the transformations, and 
`OpenAD <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/OpenAD/>`_ (see :footcite:t:`openad`).

The general approach and transformations rules were adapted from 
:footcite:t:`griewank-walther`.

This module was created as a M1 internship project in the `AIRSEA team <https://team.inria.fr/airsea/>`_ of Inria Grenoble.
