        The `parent_adj` argument is the `DataNode` of the adjoint of the \
        parent node of the `operation` node, to use in incrementing the \
        adjoints of the operands of `operation`: 
        - if the parent node is an `Assignment`, this is its LHS adjoint,
        - if the parent node is an `Operation` or `IntrinsicCall`, \
            this is the adjoint of `operation` itself.

        For all children of the Operation or IntrinsicCall node:
        - if they are Literal nodes, nothing is done, \
            there is no adjoint to increment,
        - if they are Reference nodes, the parent node 
        If some children of the Operation or IntrinsicCall node being \
        transformed are themselves Operation or IntrinsicCall nodes, \

        If this Operation/IntrinsicCall node has an Assignment node as \
        ancestor, this distinguishes between children Reference nodes that are \
        the LHS of the Assignment (in which case it is an **iterative** \
        assignment *eg* `a = a + ... * (a + ...)`) or not.

        - this first contains the adjoint incrementations of \
            *non-iterative* type,
